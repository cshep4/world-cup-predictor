# World Cup 2018 Predictor

## Introduction

World cup 2018 predictor app, designed for users to correctly predict all the scores for the 2018 world cup to score points, as well as creating mini-leagues to compete with friends.

## Technical Details

- This is built using the Ionic framework, with back-end APIs written in Kotlin using Spring Boot.
- The back-end is fully unit tested using TDD and is currently being hosted on Heroku.
- The database used to store all the data is using PostgresSQL
- A scheduled AWS Lambda function is also used to automatically call an API to update match results, as well as user scores.
- Match result data is retrieved from an external API, then used to compare against each user's predictions to assign points.
